I am a full-stack web developer located in Southern California ðŸŒž ðŸŒ´


I have always been interested in the world of tech and when I decided to start dabbling in the programming world through 
free resources on the internet, it did not take long for me to become completely hooked. My love for creativity and complex 
problem-solving, along with an eagerness to continually learn has led me to develop a passion for coding. One of my favorite 
things about coding is being able to watch an abstract idea become a tangible product that was built completely from 
scratch in just a short period of time!
