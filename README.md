I am a full-stack web developer located in Southern California ðŸŒž ðŸŒ´


I have always been interested in the world of tech and when I decided to start dabbling in the programming world through free resources on the 
internet, it did not take long for me to become completely hooked. My love for creativity and complex problem-solving, along with an eagerness to continually 
learn has led me to develop a passion for coding. One of my favorite things about coding is being able to watch an abstract idea become a tanginble product that was built completely from scratch in just a short period of time!
